The netstat command generates displays that show network status and protocol statistics. You can display the status of TCP and UDP endpoints in table format, 
routing table information, and interface information.

netstat [-m] [-n] [-s] [-i | -r] [-f address_family]


netstat -s 
option displays per protocol statistics for the UDP, TCP, ICMP, and IP protocols. The result resembles the display shown in the example below. 
(Parts of the output have been truncated.) The information can indicate areas where a protocol is having problems. For example, statistical information from ICMP can indicate where this protocol has found errors.

netstat -i.
shows the state of the network interfaces that are configured with the machine where you ran the command.

 netstat -r
displays the IP routing table.
